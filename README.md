## Overview
This project is a Security Violation Notifier system designed to monitor database operations, detect privacy breaches, log violations, and notify administrators in real-time. It demonstrates advanced PL/SQL techniques including triggers, packages, procedures, functions, and auditing.

## Problem Statement
Organizations often struggle to monitor unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive data within their databases. This system automatically tracks violations of security policies, logs incidents, and alerts administrators to ensure data privacy, accountability, and compliance.

## Key Objectives
- Detect unauthorized operations automatically.
- Log and audit all database security violations.
- Notify system administrators in real-time.
- Enhance database security and accountability.
- Serve as a reusable framework for other secure database applications.

## Features
- Real-time violation monitoring.
- Automated audit logging.
- Notifications for administrators (alerts via DBMS_OUTPUT or email).
- Weekday and public holiday operation restrictions via triggers.
- PL/SQL packages with procedures and functions for modularity.
- Cursor-based reporting for analytics.
- Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard mockups (optional).
